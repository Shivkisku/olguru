The code snippet above uses the SketchPy library to create a canvas object and import an image file in SVG format located at the specified file path. The imported image is scaled to a factor of 250 using the "scale" parameter from the "sklearn.preprocessing" module.

The "obj.draw()" function is then used to display the image on the canvas. The resulting output will be a visual representation of the imported image that has been scaled to a larger size, which can be further modified or edited using the SketchPy library's various drawing tools and functions.
